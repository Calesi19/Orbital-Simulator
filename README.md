# OrbitalSimulator

In this C++ project, users navigate a spacecraft and engage with orbiting satellites. This sophisticated simulator was developed as an exercise in implementing Design Patterns. By harnessing semi-realistic physics principles, the application captures authentic orbital dynamics and movement of objects in Earth's vicinity.
